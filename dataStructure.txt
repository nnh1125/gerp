readin: 

traverse() - travel through the directory
readFile() - open file with filename
readLine() - read the file line by line, push them into stringstream and then read word by word, create word struct if needed
readWord() - 


build-up dictionary: 

struct word {
	string theWord;
	pair <int, int> info;
}

struct file {
	string filePath;
	vector <int> lineNums;
}
